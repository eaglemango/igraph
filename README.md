# igraph

Implementation of different ways to represent graphs.

## Graph representations

* Arc Graph - edges are stored as list of pairs (from, to)
* List Graph - every node has a list of its neighbours
* Matrix Graph - edges are stored as square matrix
* Set Graph - similar to list graph, but sets are used instead of lists
